# Python-Web-Scraper
This file has two functions, representing different webcrawlers.


def wordSearch()
  First works like a search engine on BBC webpage. It looks for articles containing a specific word or phrase on the BBC webpage.
  Then it simply returns the title of the article, followed by the link and the publish-date.
  The function allows users to keep track of spefic topics.


def bbc():
  This program works similarly to the other but it works for the Home page of BBC.
